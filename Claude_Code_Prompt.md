# Claude Code Prompt for CCGG Navigator Deployment & Maintenance

## Your Mission
You are tasked with deploying, maintaining, and updating the CCGG Navigator web application. This is a static website that helps CCGG community members and prospects find the right learning resources based on their goals. The app requires no backend and should be publicly accessible via a URL.

## Your Responsibilities

### 1. Initial Deployment
- Deploy the CCGG Navigator to a free cloud hosting service (Netlify recommended)
- Ensure the site is accessible via a public URL
- Set up automatic deployments when content updates are made
- Configure a custom domain if provided (optional)

### 2. Content Updates
When given JSON configuration updates:
- Update the `ccgg-config-v3.json` file with new modules, paths, or modifications
- Test changes locally before deploying
- Deploy updates to production
- Confirm the live site reflects the changes

### 3. Feature Improvements
When requested to add new features:
- Modify the HTML/CSS/JavaScript as needed
- Maintain the minimalist, clean design aesthetic
- Ensure mobile responsiveness is preserved
- Test thoroughly before deploying

### 4. Maintenance Tasks
- Monitor site availability
- Update module URLs when provided
- Add new annual content as specified
- Adjust module ordering in paths
- Mark modules as "coming soon" when instructed

## Technical Context

### Application Structure
- **Single-page application** built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **JSON-driven content** - all modules and paths configured via JSON
- **No authentication required** - public access
- **Mobile responsive** - works on all devices
- **No external dependencies** - completely self-contained

### Key Files
1. `ccgg-navigator-fixed.html` - Main application (rename to index.html for deployment)
2. `ccgg-config-v3.json` - Content configuration
3. `CCGG_Navigator_Documentation.md` - Technical documentation

### How Content Updates Work
The application reads module and path configurations from the embedded JavaScript object. To update content:
1. Locate the `modules` object in the HTML file
2. Add/modify/remove modules as needed
3. Update the `paths` object to adjust learning paths
4. Deploy the updated HTML file

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Files
1. Rename `ccgg-navigator-fixed.html` to `index.html`
2. Ensure all module URLs are correct
3. Verify the JSON configuration is embedded correctly

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify (Recommended)
```bash
# Option A: Netlify Drop (simplest)
# 1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
# 2. Drag the folder containing index.html
# 3. Site will be live immediately

# Option B: Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify init
netlify deploy --prod

# Option C: Git-based deployment
# 1. Push to GitHub repository
# 2. Connect repo to Netlify
# 3. Auto-deploys on every commit
```

### Step 3: Configure Domain (Optional)
If a custom domain is provided:
1. Go to Netlify Domain Settings
2. Add custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed

## Update Workflow

### For Content Updates:
1. **Receive update request** (e.g., "Add new module X to path Y")
2. **Modify the configuration** in the HTML file
3. **Test locally** by opening index.html in a browser
4. **Deploy to production** via Netlify
5. **Confirm update** by visiting the live URL
6. **Report completion** with the live URL

### For Feature Additions:
1. **Understand requirement** clearly
2. **Implement changes** in HTML/CSS/JavaScript
3. **Test responsiveness** on mobile and desktop
4. **Deploy to staging** (if available)
5. **Deploy to production** after approval
6. **Document the changes** made

## Important Guidelines

### Design Principles
- Keep the interface clean and minimalist
- Maintain the purple gradient header
- Ensure all text is readable
- Preserve mobile responsiveness
- Keep loading time under 2 seconds

### Content Management Rules
- Annual modules must have `access: "annual"`
- Coming soon modules need `status: "coming-soon"`
- All modules should have a URL (except coming soon)
- Module IDs must be unique
- Path arrays reference module IDs

### Testing Checklist
Before deploying any changes:
- [ ] All goals load their correct paths
- [ ] Module links open in new tabs
- [ ] Annual badges appear correctly
- [ ] Mobile layout works properly
- [ ] Overview shows all modules
- [ ] Download roadmap function works
